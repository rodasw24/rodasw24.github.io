### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1 was one of my favorite projects because it was basically improving on code that we had written already. I was able to remember how functions work in coding from when I first coded in high school, a good refresher. The functions allowed me to be more organized and avoid repeating the same code over and over again.

    Lab 7, part 2 was also one of the projects that I really liked because of blackjack. As part of a final grade in the high school class I took, was to program a game, so I did blackjack. I like playing card games and being able to program it again in a different way was fun and interesting.

* Lab 6
    
    Lab 6, part 2 was one of the ones I liked because its main focus was dealing with loops. I was able to learn how while loops can be used alongside if statements and breaks. Loops are one thing that still sort of confuses me at times but still find interest in their usage in different situations.
